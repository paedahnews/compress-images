Motivation
----------

It was meant to be a simple, executable example on how to use the TinyPNG API with PHP.

TinyPNG has a great documentation on how to do more stuff like resizing or
using cloud services as target directory:

So feel free to use this script as a kickstarter and adapt it to your own needs.
